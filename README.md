Fancy job monitoring site using angular 5 framework. 

The repository includes an Angular 5 project called fjmSites. 
fjmSite is the prototype delivered to potentiel employer. The prototype is developed from Monday afternoon on the 8th of April 2019 until Wednesday afternoon on the 10th of April 2019. This is the second time I program using the Angular 5 framework.  

The interface shows the information about the fjm API, a list of jobs and a single job81 with details. A screenshot of the prototype frontpage is included in in the repositorie. The fjmSite project include 2 unit test, 1 succeeds and 1 is still failing.
